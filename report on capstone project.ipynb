    "Business Problem :\n",
    "Toronto has lots of stores, eateries, Coffee shops etc. The purpose is to recommend the owner the best place to open the stores/eatery. We shall try to find out the best neighborhood and store in Toronto using with Foursquare map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Necessities/ Requirements for this:\n",
    "1.\tFoursquare developer account for API calls.\n",
    "2.\tNeed Neighborhoods with Latitude and Longitude\n",
    "3.\tKnowledge of Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Data Processing and Machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "4.\tNeed Data for Toronto City.\n",

    "Acquire the data using Pandas; \n",

    "\n",
    "\tThe analysis of this data is rather limited because we used only Foursquare. The  ranking positions users’ ratings.\n",
    "\tThe Clustering function can be changed and will yield different clusters. We assumed 5, but stakeholders can change this at will.\n",
    "\tGiven the time allowed and the limited data, this was an interesting project that could very well benefit the Tourism agencies of Toronto!\n",
